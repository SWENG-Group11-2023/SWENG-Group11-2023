# Patient-Centric Question Answering System in collaboration with IBM Research

Hello and welcome to our project for the Software Engineering Project module in Trinity College Dublin. We are Group 11 and we are working together with IBM Research to improve analysation of clinical trial results in an attempt to help with solving important healthcare problems.

## Our Goal

We aim to create a web application that is a dashboard which allows users to interact with data in an intuitive way. Users will be able to interact with the data using Natural Language, specifying what they wish to extract from the data for example "Sort patients with diabetes by height", as opposed to other, time-consuming methods of trawling through data. They will then be presented with visualisations of this which will help with data analysis and they will also be able to download the extracted data in a human readable file.

## Data We Used

We are using public synthetic patient data made using Synthea. The specific file we use is the observations.csv file which can be found [here](https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea-sample-data/downloads/synthea_sample_data_csv_apr2020.zip).

A link to the website hosting the data, SyntheticMass, can be found [here](https://synthea.mitre.org/).

## Prerequisites

Docker installed on system

## How To Run

For ease of use Dockerfile's have been provided to run the program on localhost. You can decide to either manually run the docker files to you're preference or use the provided shell scripts for windows and unix to automatically run the required commands. To use the shell scripts, just execute them from terminal in the repository's root folder. Once the script completes navigate to localhost:3000 in a browser to run.
