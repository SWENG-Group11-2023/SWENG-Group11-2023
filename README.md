# Patient-Centric Question Answering System in collaboration with IBM Research

Hello and welcome to our project for the Software Engineering Project module in Trinity College Dublin. We are group 11 and we are working together with IBM Research to improve analyzation of clinical trial results in an attempt to help with solving important healthcare problems.

## Our Goal

We aim to create a web application that is a dashboard which allows users to interact with data in an intuitive way. Users will be able to interact with the data using Natural Language, specifying what they wish to extract from the data for example "Sort patients with diabetes by height". They will then be presented with visualisations of this which will help with data analysis and they will also be able to download the extracted data in a human readable file.

## Data we used

We are using public synthetic patient data made using Synthea. The specific file we use is the observations.csv file which can be found [here](https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea-sample-data/downloads/synthea_sample_data_csv_apr2020.zip).

A link to the website hosting the data, SyntheticMass, can be found [here](https://synthea.mitre.org/).
